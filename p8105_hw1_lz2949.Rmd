## Problem 1
```{r}
# installed the 'moderndive' package in console
# load the 'moderndive' library
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")

```

Variables names of this data are: `r names(early_january_weather)`. The size of this data is characterized by its rows and columns. This data contains `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns. Among these variables, temperature has a mean value of `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp), digits=2)` degrees. 

Next step is to make a scatterplot of temperature vs. time hour and describe patterns in this plot. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# plot temp vs. time_hour using ggplot 
# color points using the humid variable
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(y=temp,x=time_hour, color=humid))+geom_point()
# save the scatterplot using ggsave function
ggsave("scatterplot_hw1_p1.pdf")
```

describe the pattern


## Problem 2

```{r}
# create a data frame 
# a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
random_sample = rnorm(10)
# indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
logical_vec = random_sample>0
# create a character vector of length 10
char_vec = c("I","have","a","pet","cat","called","jumy","he","is","black-and-white")
# create a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor "levels"
vec_factor = factor(c("level1","level2","level3","level1","level2","level3","level1","level2","level3","level3"))

```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
